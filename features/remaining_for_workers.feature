Feature: Remaining time for workers
  In order to plan my vacation time exactly
  As a worker beginning to work in August
  I want to know how much leave time I have left this year

  Background:
    Given a worker exists with started_on: 2011-08-01
      And today is 2011-08-02
      And I am logged in as the worker

  Scenario: No vacation taken
     Then I should see "10" within remaining days
      And I should see the following leaves table:

  In order to always have one worker at hand
  As a boss
  I want to know how much leave time each of my workers has

  Background:
    Given a boss exists
      And a the following workers exist:
        | worker |
        | Peter  |
        | Paul   |
        | Mary   |
      And I am logged in as the boss

        | Peter |        |         |      |       |     |      |      |        |           |         |          |          | 10    |
